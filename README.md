# Hypertension Risk Prediction & Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview

This project uses real-world healthcare data to analyze hypertension prevalence and build predictive machine learning models.  
The dataset contains information on patient demographics, health indicators, and lifestyle factors.

The objective:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Explore relationships (e.g., BMI, age categories)  
- Build predictive models to estimate hypertension risk

## 🛠 Tools Used

✔ Python  
✔ Pandas  
✔ Scikit‑Learn  
✔ Matplotlib & Seaborn  
✔ Jupyter Notebook (Colab)

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature engineering (BMI categories, label encoding)
- Model training and evaluation
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Dataset exported for dashboard analysis

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Colab**
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Ensure datasets (CSV) are available in your Drive / folder

## 📂 Files Included

- `hypertension_analysis.ipynb` — Notebook with full workflow
- (Include links to other notebooks once uploaded)
